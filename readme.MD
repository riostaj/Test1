# Overview 

The script purpose is to provide DefensePro Best Practice Configuration Recommendations report (dpconfig_report.csv)

The script interacts with Radware APSolute Vision DefensePro and collects all the necessary data through REST API calls.

## IMPORTANT

● Read the entire file before attempting to configure/executing.


# Script Output

The script output generates one report in csv format. Report name is “dpconfig_report.csv”

# Setup

## Requirements

The solution requires python 3.6 and higher

### Packages required but should be part of the standard 3.6 library- no need to install

json
csv
socket
logging
smtplib
email
datetime
os
sys

### Packages required but may requires installation

urllib3
ipaddress

Use the following command in order to install urllib3

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Instructions and recommendations

1. Place the script folder into the appropriate location on the server
2. Install dependencies and necessary libraries/packages
3. Rename file `config.py example` to ‘config.py’ and set the necessary values.
4. Set up the script to run periodically (optional) though cron (linux) or windows scheduler on windows:

    Linux cron example

    0 4 * * * /path/to/app/python3 main.py #example setting the script to run every day at 4 am.

5. Navigate to the folder containing the script and run 
python3 main.py
-	Runs the script, produces all 4 reports and sends them by email
Script can be run with the following arguments (multiple arguments may be combined together)
python3 main.py --use-cache-data
-	Script parses previously collected data only (stage 2 only, no data collection)
python3 main.py --email
-	Script runs and sends email at the end
python3 main.py --test-email"
-	Script runs test email function to test email server connectivity.

# Components for the script operation

## “config.py”

“config.py” includes all the configurable variables in order to run the script. Below is the list of the configurable variables

VISION_IP = "1.1.1.1" # APSolute Vision IP
VISION_USER = "user" # APSolute Vision username
VISION_PASS = "password" # APSolute Vision password

/# Script logging set up parameters 
LOG_FILE_PATH = "./log/" # folder to save the script logging events
LOG_ROTATION_SIZE = 20000000 # Maximum rotation log file size in Bytes after which it will be split to another file
LOG_ROTATION_HISTORY = 10 # Maximum amount of log files to keep
SYSLOG_SERVER = "1.1.1.2" # Syslog server destination IP for sending events through syslog
SYSLOG_PORT = 514 # Syslog server destination UDP port

/# Email set up parameters for sending email with reports
SMTP_SERVER = "smtp.gmail.com" # SMTP server name
SMTP_SERVER_PORT = 587 # SMTP server port
SMTP_SENDER = 'sender@gmail.com' # Email sender address setting
SMTP_PASSWORD = radware # Email password (optional)
SMTP_LIST = ['recepient@radware.com'] # Email address/address list recepient/s(comma separated)
SMTP_SUBJECT_PREFIX = "ALARM:DP - " # Email Subject
SMTP_MSG_BODY = "This email was automated by the DefensePro monitoring script" # Email message body


## “main.py”

-	main.py is a main file which actually runs the script 
-	By default, the script will generate the report and send it by email.
-	The script logs errors through syslog for remote monitor and write to a local log.
-	At the end, the script sends an email with generated report attached.

## “vision.py”
	
This file includes all the instructions how to connect to the APSolute Vision and construct proper API calls to fetch the data

## logging_helper.py

	This file includes all the settings and functions for setting up the logging  and email  functionality

## dpconfig_parser.py

“dpconfig_parser.py” parses the collected data and writes deviations from the best practice into “dp_config.csv” final report. The checks are listed under the “Script output” section


# Script operation stages

## Stage 1- Data collection

At stage 1, the data is collected for all registered DefensePro/policies and is written to intermediate files.

Files necessary for the Best practice configuration review

### full_bdosprofconf_dic.json

This file is being generated once the data collection is complete and it includes all the bdos profiles configuration data.

### full_net_dic.json

This file is being generated once the data collection is complete and it includes all the network classes profiles configuration data.

### full_sig_dic.json

This file is being generated once the data collection is complete and it includes all the signature profiles configuration data.

### full_pol_dic.json

“full_pol_dic.json” is generated once the data collection is complete, it stores all the information for all the policies for all the registered DefensePro’s in the APSolute Vision and is used for the further data parsing.

# Stage 2- Data parsing

## dpconfig_parser.py

“dpconfig_parser.py” parses the collected data and writes deviations from the best practice into “dp_config.csv” final report. The checks are listed under the “Script output” section

## Stage 3 – email alert
By default, once the script finishes its operation, “dp_config.csv” report will be sent to the email address/es listed in ”config.py”.
